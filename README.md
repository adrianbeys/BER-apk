## General info
As the name implies, a bit error rate is defined as the rate at which errors occur in a transmission system. This can be directly translated into the number of errors that occur in a string of a stated number of bits. The definition of bit error rate can be translated into a simple formula: 
> BER = Errors / Total Number of Bits
> 
BER measurements compare digital input and output signals to assess what fraction of the bits are received incorrectly.
